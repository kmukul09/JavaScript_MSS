"use strict"; // treat all JS code as new version

Most important thing in coding is redability and future proof
so we need to write code with proper space and always use new line for

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ DataTypes ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

// we can see All the Data Types in documentation but thankfully javaScript does not have many DataTypes
// all of them are very simple 

// --->> Data Types 

// 1. Number => 2 to the power 53
// 2. BigInt => for bigger Numbers ( Generally not needed)
// 3. string => " "
// 4. Boolean => true / false
// 5. null => it is a standalone value / it is a representation 
// 6. undefined => we have decleared something but we have not defined it
// 7. Symbol => Unique ---> used in REACT 


/*
 Null => think of a request response system for temperature and we konw 0 degree is a temperature.
 Knowing this we requested the system for temperature and due to some reason the system is unable to fetch the data
 then what should it send in response 
 1. Should it send 0 degree ---> No because 0 degree is a temperature 
 2. So in such cases it should respond with Null 

 therefore Null means nothing eampty as it is representation of empty
*/

// To know the type Data type use " typeof " keyword

console.log(typeof null); // we get object but it is undefined so this is a error of language 
console.log(typeof undefined); // we get undefined as its type
